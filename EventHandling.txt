In react also events are same as javascript
but the difference is that we use camelCase syntax

for example, 
           in javascript we use "onclick()"
           but in react "onClick()"

In javascript, 
             with in " __ " we write the function or else 
             but in react we write curly brackets {__}.

syntax,
function Football() {
  const shoot = () => {
    alert("Great Shot!");
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={shoot}>Take the shot!</button>
  );
}
