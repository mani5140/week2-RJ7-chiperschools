STATE IN REACT JS,
            The state object is where you store property values that 
            belongs to the component.

// State in class component,

we do not need to import any hook like "useState" in class component

Syntax,

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {brand: "Ford"};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Car</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// State in functional component

In order to use state in functional component 
we have use the " useState " hook.

syntax,
       const [state, setState] = useState(100);

       here, state is the variable which store the values
             setState is method which stores the value in state variable
             useState is the hook which initially stores the value as 100;
